                     The app provides for printing the scoresheet so it can be turned in just like a paper scorsheet.
                     This is done by first taking a screenshot of the scoresheet page and then allowing the user to
                     print or email the screenshot image. The app also provides for making a screenshot of the statistics
                     page. It too can then by printed or emailed.
                     These images are maintained in the documents directory and there is only one of each. Every time a
                     new screenshot is taken, it replaces the prior one.
                     Also save a sample_scorsheet.png and a sample_statistics.png separaely that they will be available even after
                     screenshots of real scoresheets a statistics pages have been made and saved.
                     These samples will be used until they are replaced by screenshots of the live pages during a match.
